# UIDAI-Data-Hackathon-2026
Problem Statement: Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

Question I can focus on:
1. Identify states where enrolment is high but updates are low
2. Age wise enrolment growth vs demographic correction frequency
3. Urban vs rural behaviour using pincode patterns
4. Detect anomalies where updates spike unusually
5. Forecast future enrolment or update load for UIDAI planning
