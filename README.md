# UIDAI-Data-Hackathon-2026
Problem Statement: Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

Question I can focus on:
1. Identify states where enrolment is high but updates are low
2. Age wise enrolment growth vs demographic correction frequency
3. Urban vs rural behaviour using pincode patterns
4. Detect anomalies where updates spike unusually
5. Forecast future enrolment or update load for UIDAI planning

### Project Summary
This project, developed for the UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026, analyzes anonymized Aadhaar enrolment and update datasets to uncover key societal, operational, and compliance trends within India’s digital identity ecosystem. It addresses gaps between enrolment growth and update maintenance, evaluates mandatory biometric compliance among children, and compares urban–rural service usage patterns. Additionally, the project detects operational anomalies and forecasts future enrolment and update loads to support capacity planning. Overall, the solution provides actionable, data-driven insights to help Unique Identification Authority of India strengthen data quality, operational efficiency, and policy decision-making.
